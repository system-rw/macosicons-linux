> **Automatically map custom macOS (`.icns` / `.png`) icons to Linux desktop launchers. Designed for KDE Plasma, featuring a terminal-based CLI and a Tahoe-styled GUI.**

This utility bridges the gap for customization enthusiasts who want to seamlessly apply custom macOS icons to their Linux applications. No manual extraction, scaling, or desktop entry editing required.

## ✨ Features

* **Terminal & GUI Launchers:** Comes with dedicated `.desktop` files for both versions. One launches the interactive tool inside your terminal, and the other opens the standalone GUI.
* **Smart Format Support:** Handles raw PNGs and maps them cleanly.
* **Desktop Integration:** Automatically updates your system's desktop entries (`.desktop` files).
* **KDE Sync:** Forces a KDE system configuration cache rebuild (`kbuildsycoca`) so your new icons show up instantly without a system reboot.
